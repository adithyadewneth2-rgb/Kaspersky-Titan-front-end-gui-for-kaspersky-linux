## 🌌 The Mission
The Linux terminal—what I call the **"Disgusting Black Hole"**—can be a scary place for many users. I am **Adithya Dewneth** (Little Photographer), a 13-year-old developer from School Pixel LK. 

I created **Kaspersky Titan** because no one should be forced to hit the "Black Hole" just to keep their computer safe. This is a complete front-end GUI written entirely in **Python** that brings all the power of the Kaspersky CLI into a clean, easy-to-use window.

## ⚠️ Important Requirements & Compatibility

* **KFL Required:** You **MUST** have Kaspersky for Linux (KFL) installed on your PC. Titan is a front-end interface that commands the KFL engine.
* **Verified Operating Systems:** I have personally tested this and confirmed it works on:
    * ✅ **Linux Mint 23.2**
    * ✅ **Ubuntu** (All recent versions)
    * ✅ **Debian**
    * ✅ Most **Ubuntu/Debian-based distributions**.

## 🚀 Features

* **No More Typing:** Control every aspect of Kaspersky Linux with a single click.
* **Python Powered:** Lightweight, fast, and open for community improvement.
* **Debian Ready:** Compiled into a `.deb` package for instant installation.
