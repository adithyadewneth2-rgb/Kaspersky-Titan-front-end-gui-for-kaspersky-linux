## 🌌 The Mission
The Linux terminal—what I call the **"Disgusting Black Hole"**—can be a scary place for many users. I am **Adithya Denwth** (Little Photographer), a 13-year-old developer from School Pixel LK. 

I created **Kaspersky Titan** because no one should be forced to hit the "Black Hole" just to keep their computer safe. This is a complete front-end GUI written in **Python** that brings all the power of the Kaspersky CLI into a clean, easy-to-use window.

---

## ⚠️ Important Requirement
**You MUST have Kaspersky for Linux (KFL) installed on your PC.**
Titan is a front-end interface. It commands the KFL engine. If KFL is not installed, this GUI will have nothing to control!

---

## 🚀 Features
* **No More Typing:** Control every aspect of Kaspersky Linux with a single click.
* **Python Powered:** Fast, efficient, and open for community improvement.
* **Debian Ready:** Compiled into a `.deb` package for instant installation.
* **User Friendly:** Designed so that anyone, even if they aren't a Linux expert, can stay protected.

## 📥 Installation

1.  **Install KFL:** Ensure Kaspersky for Linux is already installed on your system.
2.  **Download Titan:** Download the latest `.deb` package from the [Releases](https://github.com/adithyadewneth2-rgb/Kaspersky-Titan-front-end-gui-for-kaspersky-linux/releases) section.
3.  **Run the Installer:**
    ```bash
    sudo dpkg -i titan-gui-kaspersky.deb
    sudo apt-get install -f
    ```
