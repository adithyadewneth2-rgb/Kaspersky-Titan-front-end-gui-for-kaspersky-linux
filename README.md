## 🌌 The Mission
The Linux terminal—what I call the **"Disgusting Black Hole"**—can be a scary place for many users. I am **Adithya Dewneth** (Little Photographer), a 13-year-old developer from School Pixel LK. 

I created **Kaspersky Titan** because no one should be forced to hit the "Black Hole" just to keep their computer safe. This is a complete front-end GUI written entirely in **Python** that brings all the power of the Kaspersky CLI into a clean, easy-to-use window.

    * ✅ **Linux Mint 23.2**
    * ✅ **Ubuntu** (All recent versions)
    * ✅ **Debian**
    * ✅ Most **Ubuntu/Debian-based distributions**.
