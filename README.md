## 🌌 The Mission
The Linux terminal—what I call the **"Disgusting Black Hole"**—can be a scary place for many users. I am **Adithya Denwth** (Little Photographer), a 13-year-old developer from School Pixel LK. 

I created **Kaspersky Titan** because no one should be forced to hit the "Black Hole" just to keep their computer safe. This is a complete front-end GUI written entirely in **Python** that brings all the power of the Kaspersky CLI into a clean, easy-to-use window.

## ⚠️ Important Requirements & Compatibility
* **KFL Required:** You **MUST** have Kaspersky for Linux (KFL) installed on your PC. Titan is a front-end interface that commands the KFL engine.
* **Prioritized Version:** I developed this specifically for the **Standard Linux version of KFL**. 
* **Compatibility Note:** I do not know yet if it works on other specialized distributions. If you test it on different versions, please let me know!

## 🚀 Features
* **No More Typing:** Control every aspect of Kaspersky Linux with a single click.
* **Python Powered:** Lightweight, fast, and open for community improvement.
* **Debian Ready:** Compiled into a `.deb` package for instant installation.
